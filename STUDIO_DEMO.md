# 🎨 Rawbify Studio - Visual Data Transformation

## What We Built: The "Scratch for Data" 

**Inspired by children's coding blocks but for DATA!** 

### 🌟 Key Features

1. **Visual Block Interface** - Drag & drop data transformation steps
2. **Live Preview** - See your data change in real-time  
3. **Simple Configuration** - Each block has easy settings
4. **Pipeline Flow** - Connect blocks with animated arrows

- **Flowing arrows** between connected blocks
- **Live data preview** with tables
- **Modal configuration** for each block

This is exactly what micro-SaaS should be: **Simple, focused, beautiful, and profitable!**

## Next Steps

1. Connect to your existing AI backend
2. Add file upload functionality
